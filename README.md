# MY 30 DAY MASTER PLAN

My plan for the next thirty days is to MASTER HUGGINGFACE, LLMs, and STREAMLIT. 

These three powerhouses have the potential to revolutionize how we interact with and understand natural language. 

I am on a mission to level up my skills with the guidance of my mentor, SHARATH RAJU 👨‍🏫 from Udemy. 

### FIRST PROJECT: A SIMPLE QUESTION ANSWERING APPLICATION

As a first step, I have completed my first project - a PRETTY COOL Question Answering App using HuggingFace, OpenAI, and Streamlit 

🔥 The app is pretty simple, but it was nice learning how to call OpenAI models in private Streamlit environments as shown. 

Highlights of the project: 

🔥 Learned how to finetune OpenAI models using pdfs of text
🔥 Learned how to leverage OpenAI's lanchain.llms for delivering precise answers
🔥 Learned how to create intuitive UI interfaces using Streamlit

I've got an arsenal of exciting projects lined up, each designed to deepen my understanding in HuggingFace, OpenAI, and LLMs. 

For those affected by layoffs or still seeking full time roles: PUSHPUSHPUSH!!! 🚀 AI can never replace us!! We are here to stay. It's just that we have to push our brains to grow faster than we used to!!!! Small daily improvements, if done consistently over time, lead to stunning results!!!
